# TavernMod

Before running you will need to install lime and Haxe, to do so follow this guide: https://kadedev.github.io/Kade-Engine/building. Even though it's for Kade Engine the install process is the same.

To run the mod, go to the root of the folder in File Explorer (usually named TavernMod), click File in the top left, and open Windows PowerShell. Type "lime test windows" or "lime test windows -debug" if you prefer having the Haxeflixel debug menu. If it doesn't work, make sure you don't have another file or folder highlighted in file explorer.
This creates an executable in a new folder called "export", so your first time running this command will take a while in order to build the exe.

To contribute files to the build install GitHub Desktop you can find it here: https://desktop.github.com/
When you add/change/remove files commit the files to master and then push it. You'll need to ask Poke to be able to push files though.
