# TavernMod

To run the mod as it is, go to TavernMod/export/release/windows/bin and launch Psych Engine.

To run the mod with any changes you've made, go to the root of the folder in File Explorer (usually named TavernMod), click File in the top left, and open Windows PowerShell. Type "lime test windows" or "lime test windows -debug" if you prefer having the Haxeflixel debug menu. If it doesn't work, make sure you don't have another file or folder highlighted in file explorer.
