# TavernMod

To run the mod, go to the root of the folder in File Explorer (usually named TavernMod), click File in the top left, and open Windows PowerShell. Type "lime test windows" or "lime test windows -debug" if you prefer having the Haxeflixel debug menu. If it doesn't work, make sure you don't have another file or folder highlighted in file explorer.
This creates an executable in a new folder called "export", so your first time running this command will take a while in order to build the exe.
